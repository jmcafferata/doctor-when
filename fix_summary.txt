The main image animation on mobile devices was starting from an incorrect vertical position because it relied on a hardcoded calculation (`calc(50vh - 50% - 60px)`) that didn't account for the actual image dimensions or layout context accurately.

I fixed this by updating the `mobilePresentationPan` keyframes in `public/style.css` to use the `--hero-start-y` CSS variable. This variable is dynamically calculated in JavaScript (`prepareHeroPresentationOffsets` function) to determine the exact offset needed to center the image in the viewport, ensuring the animation starts from the true center of the screen.
